# Frontend Mentor - Pricing component with toggle

![Design preview for the Pricing component with toggle coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this ***pricing component** and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

To do this challenge, I used **Bootstrap 5** to manage the responsiveness, CSS and **Javascript**.
